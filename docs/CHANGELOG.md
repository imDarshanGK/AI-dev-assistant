# Changelog

All notable changes to QyverixAI are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added a dedicated changelog page in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- Added changelog guidance for contributors and PR authors.
- Added `POST /auth/logout` to revoke the caller's access token.

### Changed
- Linked the changelog from `README.md` for faster discoverability.

### Security
- Hardened authentication against token replay: access tokens now carry a
  unique `jti`, and revoked tokens (e.g. after logout) are rejected via a
  server-side denylist until they expire.
- Secure authentication endpoints by enforcing sliding-window rate limiting (5 attempts per minute per IP) on signup and login POST requests, preventing brute-force and credential-stuffing attacks.
